

Design a responsive web UI for a web app called **“Ozu Admin”**, used to manage delivery shipments.

Style guidelines:

* Classic, minimal design.
* Mostly white or very light grey background with **one subtle accent color** only (e.g. a calm blue). No bright multi-color gradients.
* Clean typography, good hierarchy, enough white space.
* All elements should be perfectly aligned in a grid, with consistent margins, padding, and button sizes.
* Use simple, soft shadows and rounded corners for cards and inputs.
* The layout should look great on desktop but also adapt to tablet and mobile.

Screens to design:

1. **Login Screen**

   * Centered card on a light background.
   * Top: simple square logo icon and text “Ozu Admin”.
   * Subtitle: “Sign in to manage deliveries”.
   * Inside the card:

     * Heading: “Welcome back”.
     * Email address field with email icon.
     * Password field with lock icon.
     * “Forgot password?” text link aligned to the right under the password field.
     * Primary “Sign In” button full width.
     * Below: “Don’t have an account?” with “Sign up” link.
   * Everything vertically centered with balanced spacing between elements.

2. **Admin Shipment Portal (Dashboard)**

   * Page title: “Admin Shipment Portal” with “Welcome, [user name]” under it.
   * Overall layout: a simple **two-column grid** on desktop.
   * Top section under the title:

     * A card for saved addresses (with text like “No addresses found” and a secondary button “Add Address in Profile”).
     * Below that, a single field: “Your Mobile Number (Shared with rider)” with an input and hint to update in profile settings.
   * Top-right navigation as a horizontal row of buttons or pill-style tabs: **Profile, Issues, Riders, Map, Sign Out**.

     * Same accent color for the primary action; the rest in subtle neutral tones with clear hover states.
   * Left column: **Create Delivery Request** card

     * Fields stacked vertically with good spacing and labels:

       * Customer Location (search input)
       * Customer Name
       * Customer Mobile Number
       * Delivery Price (₹) (with small helper text “Amount rider will receive”)
     * At the bottom, a disabled primary button with label like “Please enable location & mobile number”.
   * Right column: **Shipments card**

     * Tabs at the top: “Active Shipments” and “Completed”.
     * Card content centered with an icon and text “No active shipments” when empty.
   * Consistent border radius, font sizes, and spacing across all cards, inputs, and buttons.

General behavior:

* Use neutral background and borders to keep the look classic and professional, avoiding strong or distracting colors.
* Ensure every label, input, and button is aligned on the same vertical grid; avoid misaligned edges.
* Provide generous padding inside cards and sections so the interface feels airy and not cramped.
